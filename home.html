We wanted to assess how people would interpret and interact with the information on the page and if they would make any errors in interacting with the application.</p>

					    <p class="card-text">In general, the users completed the tasks correctly and were not confused. When the users put themselves in the shoes of someone with a learning disability, they did, however, note that a user with learning disabilities may get confused by whether or not the service applied to them since it wasn’t clear from the homepage. Interactions with the application itself, however, were in line with what we expected.</p>

					    <p class="card-text">User feedback was mostly in line with what we expected, however, one user noted that if someone had a learning disability or suspected that they did, it may be hard for that person to self-identify with the information on the homepage which may lead them to not get into the self-assessment and subsequently the tele-assessment. Another user noted that once they get into the tele-assessment, the user would likely self-identify and likely wouldn’t drop out of the application, however, it seems that the initial resistance for the user to enter into the self-assessment would be the biggest hurdle. </p>
