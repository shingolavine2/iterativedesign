    <p class="text-center">
      For this assignment, we created a brand-new interface for the Thrive
      Education startup (now known as
      <a href="https://www.hellopolygon.com/">Polygon</a>). Thrive Education
      offers tele-assessments for identifying learning and developmental
      differences.
    </p>
    <p class="text-center">
      We started by narrowing down this startup's focus. Our goal was to target
      motivated, self-driven students primarily in college. These students
      aren't satisfied with how they're currently doing. They want to see if
      there's a reason behind this.
    </p>
    <p class="text-center">
      Students start with a short self-assessment. Then, they get directed to
      schedule a tele-assessment with the startup's staff. They can also skip
      directly to scheduling a tele-assessment if they know they have a learning
      disability.

	    <p>During the studio mockup crit, we got the following feedback:</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>
	        If your goal is onboarding, think about how to achieve your desired
	        metrics
	      </li>
	      <li>
	        To help readability, use icons to your advantage and create a clear text
	        hierarchy
	      </li>
	      <li>Perhaps focus on one persona to create a more focused interface</li>
	      <li>
	        Think about what a successful outcome would be from using your interface
	      </li>
	    </ul>

	      We incorporated the feedback by focusing on a college student persona,
	      adding icons to help with readability, and removing the "schools" and
	      "parents" user flows:

                The task we gave was for users to assess what offerings were
                available on the homepage and the site in general and for them
                to assess whether or not they would drop out of the assessment
                once they started. We wanted to assess how people would
                interpret and interact with the information on the page and if
                they would make any errors in interacting with the application.

                In general, the users completed the tasks correctly and were not
                confused. When the users put themselves in the shoes of someone
                with a learning disability, they did, however, note that a user
                with learning disabilities may get confused by whether or not
                the service applied to them since it wasn’t clear from the
                homepage. Interactions with the application itself, however,
                were in line with what we expected.

              <p class="card-text">
                User feedback was mostly in line with what we expected, however,
                one user noted that if someone had a learning disability or
                suspected that they did, it may be hard for that person to
                self-identify with the information on the homepage which may
                lead them to not get into the self-assessment and subsequently
                the tele-assessment. Another user noted that once they get into
                the tele-assessment, the user would likely self-identify and
                likely wouldn’t drop out of the application, however, it seems
                that the initial resistance for the user to enter into the
                self-assessment would be the biggest hurdle.

                If some changes were to be made to the site, we would add more
                information to the home page to help users with learning
                disabilities self-identify and make it easier for them to enter
                into the self-assessment.
