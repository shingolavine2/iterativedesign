					 <h2>Background</h2>
					 <p>For this assignment, we created a brand-new interface for the Thrive Education startup (now known as <a href="https://www.hellopolygon.com/">Polygon</a>). Thrive Education offers tele-assessments for identifying learning and developmental differences.</p>
					 <p>We started by narrowing down this startup's focus. Our goal was to target motivated, self-driven students primarily in college. These students aren't satisfied with how they're currently doing. They want to see if there's a reason behind this.</p>
					 <p>Students start with a short self-assessment. Then, they get directed to schedule a tele-assessment with the startup's staff. They can also skip directly to scheduling a tele-assessment if they know they have a learning disability.</p>

					<h2>Sketches</h2>
					<p>Before designing, we did some sketches, each with one of the following things in mind:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Schedule an Assessment Page &#x2192; Get Assessed &#x2192; Report Page (Targeted at a student)</li>
						<li>Home Page “learn more” &#x2192; Testimonies (parents) &#x2192; Schedule an Assessment (Targeted at a parent)</li>
						<li>Home Page &#x2192; Benefits to Schools Page &#x2192; Schedule a Demo (Targeted at a School)</li>
						<li>Home &#x2192; initial questions in “Self-Assessment” &#x2192; have user fill out personal info &#x2192; email</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Wireframe</h2>
					<p>From here, we created a wireframe combining all of these ideas.</p>
